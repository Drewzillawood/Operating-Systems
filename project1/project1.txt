Through this project we were to demonstrate an understanding of how a shell functions. 
I was able to understand how a kernel receives text input and can translate that into 
commands to execute a program. On top of this was the process of understanding
forks and how they can create a dependent chain down through their children.

Taking advantage of built in functions like wait, execpv and so on were vital 
to my understanding on this project. My biggest learning curve was just remembering
how to parse a string properly in C once again. Most of the rest of the concepts came
fairly naturally. The last part on running a program in the background is something 
I haven't fully grasped quite yet though.
